JAKE,This job is eating me alive. I can't breathe anymore.
JAKE,"I spent all these years trying to be the good guy, the man in the white hat. I'm not becoming like them... I am them."
AMY,"What are you doing, weirdo?"
JAKE,"I'm doing the best speech from ""Donnie Brasco."" Actually-- --ten of me are doing the best speech from Donnie Brasco. Sup?"
AMY,"Get it together, man. All ten of you."
AMY,Store was hit about two hours ago. Perps disabled the alarm
JAKE,Sorry! My bad.
AMY,"I'd like a list of your employees, anyone who had access to the store. I'd also like to apologize for my partner. His parents didn't give him enough attention."
JAKE,DO YOU BELIEVE IN LIFE AFTER LOVE? --
AMY,"Dude, seriously?"
JAKE,"I know, not my first choice either, but it's stuck. Got any other songs, Ahmed?"
AHMED,"No, is broken. You want it? One-fifty for you. Works perfect."
JAKE,"You literally just said it was broken. (singing) I THINK THIS ROBB-RY WAS A SMASH AND GRAB I REALLY BELIEVE IT WAS A SMASH AND GRAB, OH!!!"
AMY,"Really, Cher? I think it was an inside job. Prove me wrong."
JAKE,"A challenge? Is this a challenge? I love challenges! The door and the register were both forced, and they tripped a motion sensor -- i.e., not an inside job."
AMY,Or it's an inside job meant to look like a smash and grab.
JAKE,"Sorry. We're looking for three white males, one of whom has tatt sleeves on both arms."
AMY,"And how do you know that, dare I ask?"
JAKE,"I had a confidential informant on the inside. He spent years right here, in this sale bin, watching, learning, waiting. His code name is... (holds up teddy bear) Fuzzy Cuddle Bear! And he's a nanny cam."
AMY,Ugh. You got lucky.
JAKE,"You know what they say: Luck is 95% talent, 5% being awesome."
AMY,No one's ever said that.
JAKE,"(to the bear) Whelp... we did it, Fuzzy. We got 'em. You can come home now. (as the bear) ""I don't know if I can. I've been undercover so long, I don't even know who I am anymore. I've done terrible things."""
AMY,All right.
JAKE,"(as Fuzzy, crying) ""I strangled a Mr. Potato Head with my bare hands. Oh God, what have I become?!"""
TERRY,All right. Let's get started.
TERRY,"Quiet, please. Come on, guys, I don't want to have to raise my voice. Rosa?"
ROSA,Shut up! Everyone shuts up.
TERRY,"Thank you, Rosa. First off, Gina has some administrative announcements."
GINA,"Thank you. Thank you. No need to applaud. First of all, starting today there's a new claim form for ""lost equipment."" Sadly, I have misplaced it."
GINA,"But seriously, I do not know where I put those forms. If you see them, let me know. Also, my dance troupe, ""Floor-gasm,"" is performing at the Atlantic Antic on Sunday. Please come watch me dance, unless you are an old pervert."
TERRY,"Thank you, Gina. Open cases -- you closed the electronics store robbery from last week?"
JAKE,"Patrol picked up all three mopes yesterday, Sarge. Would you like to do the honor?"
AMY,I hate this. I hate this. Enjoy it while it lasts.
JAKE,I will!
TERRY,"JP, update on the Morgenthau murder?"
JAKE,"Early this morning, someone decided to shoot and kill luxury food importer Harry Morgenthau. Body was discovered by his cleaning lady. During her interview, using expert detective work, I deduced that she had something super gross on her chin. I took a picture of it, as evidence."
CHARLES,I think it was flan.
JAKE,Charles thinks it was flan. I think it was butterscotch pudding.
ROSA,"Maybe it was just, like, that old person gunk. You know the way they're always covered in gunk? Oldies are gross."
TERRY,"How about we focus on the murder, instead of the old person gunk?"
AMY,"Crime techs are at the scene now, we're heading back in a few minutes."
TERRY,I want the four of you on this -- it's gonna be priority one for new C.O.
ROSA,"Tell us about this new captain. You worked with him before, right?"
TERRY,Years ago. Captain Holt will be here soon. He'll want to introduce himself.
AMY,"Well, as soon as he's settled in, I have a presentation for him. (pulls out folder) Crime-stat analysis for the precinct, and some strategy proposals."
JAKE,"Oh, are you hoping to be put in charge of the Brown Noser Squad, Sergeant Asskisser?"
CHARLES,"Yeah, then maybe one day you can be Lieutenant Asskisser, on the Brown Noser Squad."
JAKE,That's exactly what I said.
CHARLES,"Great minds, right?"
TERRY,"Put the murder down, guys. Dismissed."
CHARLES,"Hey Gina, you know any scalpers? I want to buy tickets for the Rihanna concert for me and Rosa, but they're sold out."
GINA,"...Okay, yeah, two points to make here. First: Rihanna? (gesturing vaguely to him) You... Rihanna. "
CHARLES,Yes. What's your second point?
GINA,"That you're wasting your time. She's got a type, which is: anyone but you."
CHARLES,"Yeah, that was my ex-wife's type, too."
GINA,"A Rihanna concert is a pretty big swing, man. She's into watching old movies. Maybe start there."
CHARLES,Cool. Where... would I find a place that shows old movies?
GINA,"Just go on the internet and search for the phrase ""I want to buy two movie tickets for a girl who doesn't like me."""
CHARLES,"...I don't even need to add the zip code, or something?"
JAKE,Just got these crime scene photos -- look at the victim's socks.
AMY,...What? I don't see anything.
JAKE,"No, just -- they're super nice socks, right? Where do you get socks like that? I have the worst socks."
AMY,Hey -- have you heard anything about the new captain?
JAKE,"No, and I don't care. Terry runs the detective squad, and he's great."
AMY,Terry's an emotional wreck.
JAKE,"Yes, but he's our emotional wreck. I wish Captain McGintly had never left. He was the best."
AMY,He was terrible. You just liked him because he let you do anything you wanted.
MCGINTLEY,What the hell are you doing?
JAKE,Fire extinguisher roller chair derby.
MCGINTLEY,...Okay.
ROSA,-- annnnnd go!
AMY,If I'm ever gonna make captain I need a good mentor. I need my rabbi.
JAKE,"Sorry, dude. This new guy's gonna be a washed-up pencil pusher, who's forgotten how to be a cop, and is only concerned with -- -- following every rule in the Patrol Guide, meep morp robot captain engage."
HOLT,Is that what you think?
JAKE,Hey! You must be the new C.O. Detective Jake Peralta. Great to meet you.
HOLT,Don't let me interrupt. You were describing what kind of person I'm going to be. I'd like you to finish. 
JAKE,"Well, lemme see... ""washed-up pencil- pusher""... ""forgotten how to be a cop""... I think I was done, actually."
HOLT,Okay. Now do the robot voice. The robot voice you were doing when you implied I'm a rule-following robot. I want to hear it again.
JAKE,"...""Meep morp... zeep... robot..."""
HOLT,"That's a terrible robot voice. And the next time I see you, I'd like you to be wearing a necktie."
JAKE,Our old captain didn't care if we wore ties.
HOLT,"Well, your new captain does. And more importantly, he cares that you follow his direct orders. Everyone. I'm your new commanding officer, Captain Ray Holt."
AMY,Speech! Speech!
HOLT,"That was my speech. Sergeant Jeffords, a word?"
AMY,I love that guy.
GINA,"Yeah, he's really suave. Anyone else get kind of a gay vibe?"
HOLT,Sergeant. You were in the 18th with me. Though you were significantly...
TERRY,"Fatter, sir. They called me Terry Titties. Because I had... large..."
HOLT,"Titties. Yes. I remember. I never liked that nickname. Though to be fair, it was accurate. Says here you're on administrative leave?"
TERRY,"A year ago, my wife and I had twin baby girls. Cagney and Lacey. Ever since, I've kind of... clenched up. Lost my edge. There was an incident."
TERRY,You go in first. I'm feeling jumpy.
JAKE,"What? You always go in first. Look at you -- those biceps don't go in ""second."" "
JAKE,I think he's dead.
TERRY,"It's been a year, and I... haven't..."
HOLT,Tell me about your detective squad.
TERRY,"Scully, Hitchcock, and Daniels. They're pretty much worthless. But they make good coffee."
HOLT,Copy that.
TERRY,"Now the good ones. Rosa Diaz: tough, smart, hard to read, and scary as hell."
ROSA,Tell me who has me for Secret Santa.
HITCHCOCK,No! That takes all the fun out of it.
HITCHCOCK,It's Scully. He got you a scarf. It's blue and ugly. I'll make him return it.
TERRY,"Charles Boyle: he's a grinder. Not the most brilliant detective, but he works harder than anyone else. He's not physically... gifted."
CHARLES,Awww man! My muffin!
CHARLES,Ow! My head! My muffin and my head!
TERRY,"Amy Santiago: first girl cop in a family of cops. Gets underestimated because of her looks, so she's always trying to prove she's tough."
AMY,You think I can't handle this much hot sauce? I can handle way more than this.
AMY,In... your... face.
SCULLY,...I didn't say anything.
TERRY,"She and Peralta have some big bet over who gets more arrests this year. At first I objected, but ever since the bet, their numbers have gone way up."
HOLT,Tell me about Peralta.
TERRY,Jacob Peralta is my best detective -- he likes putting away bad guys and he loves solving puzzles. The only puzzle he hasn't solved... is how to grow up.
HOLT,That's very well put.
TERRY,I've talked a lot about Jake in my departmentally-mandated therapy sessions.
HOLT,"They finally gave me my shot, Terry. You know my history -- you know how important this is to me. This precinct is doing fine. But I want to make it the best in Brooklyn. And I need your help."
TERRY,"Absolutely, sir. Where do we start?"
HOLT,We start with him.
JAKE,"Okay. Perp came in through the window, left that muddy footprint, broke that cabinet -- hold on, hold on. Is everyone wearing a necktie? Because it's impossible to solve crimes if you're not wearing a tie."
AMY,Shell casings found here. ...Two shots. Bang... bang.
JAKE,"I concur. Good work, detective. You get a tie."
CHARLES,That's mine. You took it out of my desk.
JAKE,"That's right, Boyle. Good solve."
CHARLES,Thanks!
AMY,Shut up about Holt -- that man is going to be my rabbi.
JAKE,"First of all, it's very weird to hear a Cuban woman refer to an African American man as her rabbi. Secondly, your ""rabbi's"" a pain in my ass."
CHARLES,"Yeah, he's a little too serious. What do you think, Rosa?"
ROSA,Seems cool.
CHARLES,"Yeah, seems cool, I agree."
ROSA,"Looks like the perp stole: a computer, a watch, and a jamon iberico ham, valued at... what?! Six thousand bucks?"
JAKE,"A ham for $6000? Is it from a talking pig? Is it made out of ""Babe"
CHARLES,"Jamon iberico is an amazing cured ham from Spain. They had it at my uncle's funeral. I gorged myself at that funeral. I was constipated for three days. Rest in peace, Uncle Johnny."
JAKE,A murder and a ham heist? Things just got interesting. This is Captain Ray Holt. We're gonna need some extra ties.
HOLT,"Speaking of ties, where's yours, Meep-Morp?"
JAKE,You gotta be kidding me. Hi Captain! What are you doing here?
HOLT,I like to know what my detectives are up to. Take Santiago and knock on doors -- see if the neighbors heard anything.
JAKE,Door duty? It's a waste of time.
HOLT,Diaz and Boyle check in with the coroner. Report back to me in an hour.
JAKE,I think he's starting to like me!
HOLT,"No, I'm not."
CHARLES,"Hey, Rosa. I just happened to notice, there's an old movie festival at the Film Forum this week. You want to go?"
ROSA,Sure.
CHARLES,"Cool! Awesome. There's a bunch of movie options, so I'll send you those options, and you can pick an option and we will watch that option."
ROSA,You just pick.
CHARLES,"Yeah. I can definitely do that. I'll probably just go with something classic? Like ""Citizen Kane."""
ROSA,"""Citizen Kane"" is terrible. Pick a good movie."
CHARLES,It's every critic's favorite movie.
JAKE,Let the wasting of time begin.
AMY,"As my grandpa used to say, ""You gotta smell a lot of feet before you find the six-toed prince."""
JAKE,What?
AMY,Cuba's a weird place. It means
JAKE,The reward is a six-toed prince?!
AMY,"Hello, sir -- can we ask you a few questions?"
BUNDER,"Definitely. I'm actually super glad you guys are here. Are you smelling that weed smell? A dude just broke in here, smoked weed, and bolted."
JAKE,"Yeah, that checks out."
AMY,What is your name?
BRJKOL,My name Brjkolj. B-R-J-K-O-L-J.
JAKE,"So, just like it sounds."
AMY,Have you ever seen this man before? He was shot last night.
BRJKOL,Thank you. Brjkolj like.
AMY,...Sir? That's ours. We need that. And he kept it.
JAKE,Has anyone in the history of police work ever solved a crime by doing door duty?
AMY,"First of all, yes. Many, many times. Secondly, my dad met my mom doing door duty in Queens."
JAKE,"Well, I doubt you're going to meet thefuture Mr. Santiago in this hallway."
AMY,"I don't know. Wall Street Journal on the doormat, corner apartment... Twenty bucks says this guy's like a hot banker."
JAKE,"I'll take that action. Police, open up please."
OLD MAN,Hello?!
JAKE,"Hello, sir! My name is Detective Right-All-The-Time, and this is my partner, Detective Terribledetective."
AMY,We were wondering if you heard anything unusual last night? And are you single?
OLD MAN,Yes. But I'm also dying.
HOLT,"So Gina: in my experience, civilian administrators such as yourself often have their ear to the ground. What do Santiago and Peralta have riding on this bet of theirs?"
GINA,"I'll tell you, on six conditions. Number One: you let me use your office to practice m' dance moves. Second--"
HOLT,"How about this: if you tell me, I won't have you suspended without pay."
GINA,"That sounds great. The bet is: if Amy gets more arrests, Jake has to give her his car. It's an old Mustang, pretty sweet. If he gets more arrests, she has to go on a date with him."
HOLT,Just one date?
GINA,"He guarantees it'll end in sex. She says it won't. I don't know, though, Jake's got some moves. I'd bet on at least some over-the-clothes action."
HOLT,"That's enough. Thank you, Gina."
GINA,I think you would get a real kick out of my jams.
HOLT,You cannot dance in my office.
GINA,Copy that.
CHARLES,"No surprises from the coroner. Two gunshots, shoulder and chest."
JAKE,"None of the neighbors heard or saw anything. And what's worse, Santiago struck out with a 90 year-old. Hard. It was embarrassing."
HOLT,"All right. Hit the pawn shops. Canvas the neighborhood. And while you're out, you can buy yourself a tie."
JAKE,"Oh, I'm wearing a tie right now. Check it out: Secret tie!"
HOLT,"First of all, you're kind of over-doing it on the man-scaping. But more importantly, why do you refuse to take my orders seriously, Detective?"
JAKE,"Because, sir, if you're wound too tight, you end up like Terry."
TERRY,Daddy's gonna be home soon. I love you. I just love you so much.
JAKE,Crying at your desk and playing with sock puppets.
HOLT,"There's a middle ground, Detective. Does anyone here know why it's important to me that you dress appropriately? And it has nothing to do with the Patrol Guide."
ROSA,Guys look good in ties.
CHARLES,"Yes, they do! I'm wearing one right now!"
AMY,Show respect for the job. Pride. Confidence? Happiness.
JAKE,Are we just naming positive things? Rainbows. Kittens. Thanksgiving dinner!
HOLT,Hmm. Four highly-trained detectives and not one of you can solve this simple mystery. I want to be briefed on any new angles. Any questions?
JAKE,"Well, I was curious whether you thought I was doing too much man-scaping, and apparently you do, so I'm good."
JAKE,"Hey, what about that expensive jamon iber-crap stuff? The perp left a really expensive TV behind, but stole ham? Is there a place near the crime scene that sells it?"
CHARLES,"Beneficio's might. Their cured meats section is ridiculous. Though, I mainly think of it as a gelato place--"
JAKE,Stop talking. Let's go.
CHARLES,You gotta brief the C.O. first.
JAKE,We'll brief him after we catch the guy.
RATKO,"My name is Ratko, I don't know anything."
JAKE,"Okay, Ratko. Just a few questions. Do you recognize him? Henry Morgenthau?"
RATKO,No.
JAKE,"Look at the picture first, maybe, Ratko."
RATKO,I tell you. I don't know him. I don't know what happened. No more questions!
JAKE,"Okay, I'll tell you what happened. He came by and said he had some hams to sell. You knew they were worth a lot of money, so you tried to rob him when he wasn't home. Only he was home, and he fought back, so you shot him. Am I close? Nod your giant caveman head and drool if I'm close."
JAKE,"Oh man, I hate running! Ratko stop! Stop Ratko!"
JAKE,"Ow! Ratko, I'm getting mad."
CHARLES,That's thirty dollar marmalade!
RATKO,I not mean to kill. It not my fault.
JAKE,Okay. Okay. I believe you. Be cool.
CHARLES,It really is the best gelato in the city.
TERRY,What the hell happened? And what's on your face?
CHARLES,Passion fruit sorbet.
JAKE,"Good news is: we found the murderer. Ratko Slovic, a Serbian butcher. Robbery gone bad. He confessed and everything."
HOLT,"I don't see a Serbian butcher in here, so I assume there's bad news."
JAKE,"Charles and I may have allowed Ratko to escape. But, one more piece of good news:"
JAKE,(sing-songy) I got you some hazelnut! 
JAKE,"He's seriously assigning me to the records room? Why do we even have a records room? The computer has been invented, right?"
TERRY,"You're lucky, man. I wish I could get assigned here full time. You could not be farther from the action."
JAKE,"Sergeant, you know me. I have more arrests than anyone. Can you please tell the captain how dumb it is to lock his best detective in a file cabinet?"
AMY,Second best.
TERRY,"You're wrong about Holt. That man has forgotten more about being a cop than you'll ever know. In 1981, he caught the Disco Strangler."
HOLT,"It's over, Disco Man. Put down the yo-yo and back away from the girl."
TERRY,He's the real deal. You should listen to him.
AMY,"It's gonna be hard to win our bet when you're on the bench, Peralta. Although, I did start a new category --"
AMY,Look at that! You're winning!
JAKE,Slam! That was a slam! Pretend that slammed.
ROSA,So? What movie did you get tickets to?
CHARLES,"Well, just to be safe, I bought tickets to all of them."
ROSA,"""Just to be safe?"" What does that mean?"
CHARLES,"I don't know. I didn't want to mess up, because you're sort of... opinionated."
ROSA,"You think I'm opinionated? Okay, here's an opinion for you: you're a bad judge of character and your shirt looks like vomit."
CHARLES,...So we could see North by Northwest--
ROSA,We are not seeing a movie together.
CHARLES,Sounds good.
HOLT,"So, you found something? I like the tie."
JAKE,"I was skeptical, but it really did make a difference in my work. I think I found something interesting in these files. Here, let me show you."
HOLT,I'm glad you've made progress in the case. Let's have you brief the team. Holt grabs Jake's pants and heads towards the bullpen.
JAKE,...That's not necessary.
JAKE,"Yes. Well. Thank you all for coming. Including -- oh! -- Craig, our crime scene photographer. "
JAKE,"Great. So. After being unfairly tossed into the records room for no reason, I got so bored I started reading some old cases."
HOLT,A novel idea. 
JAKE,"""Ratko"" was a made-up name, but: after looking through a million files, one of which I literally found in a spiderweb, I found a bunch of references to a Serbian thug, street names: ""The Rat"" and ""The Butcher."" Suspect in a few break-ins -- used to hang out at a storage unit near Boerum Park...which has red soil, hence the muddy red footprints on Monganthau's counter. Also, I am freezing. Can I put my pants on now? "
HOLT,"Fine work, Detective. Let's give Peralta a hand, everyone. "
JAKE,Thank you. Thanks. That's nice.
AMY,No record of Ratko on their ledger. Must have used cash.
HOLT,Maybe we'll get lucky and he'll turn up.
JAKE,"Well, I for one am very excited to be on a stakeout with you, Captain. You know what my fave part of stakeouts is? Patrol guide says: casual dress."
HOLT,Does he always talk this much?
AMY,I just tune it out. It's like a white noise machine.
JAKE,"First off, that's racist. Second of all, you caught the Disco Strangler, right? That dude wrapped a lot of yo-yos around a lot of hookers' necks. Nice collar. But the thing I can't understand is: young superstar detective takes down a serial killer... why'd it take you so long to get your first command?"
HOLT,Because I'm gay.
JAKE,...Seriously?
HOLT,I'm surprised you didn't know. I don't try to hide it.
JAKE,Damn. I am not a good detective.
ROSA,Hey. I feel bad that you spent all that money on movie tickets. Take this.
CHARLES,Why don't you just come to the movies?
ROSA,No thanks.
CHARLES,...Okay. Well. This is awkward.
ROSA,It's not awkward. I like your company. You're sweet.
JAKE,"Captain, when I had my pants off, in no way was I... I didn't know about your gay... gayness."
HOLT,"I know, Peralta. You're a lot of things, but you're not a homophobe."
AMY,When did you come out?
HOLT,"About twenty-five years ago. The NYPD was not ready for an openly gay detective. Then the old guard died, and suddenly, they couldn't wait to show off the fact that they had a high-ranking gay officer. I made captain, but they put me into a public affairs unit. I was a good soldier, helped recruitment... but all I ever wanted was a command. Now, I finally got one, and I'm not going to screw it up."
JAKE,I feel dumb.
AMY,"My God. I have to thank you, Captain, because at this moment, Peralta is feeling humility, for maybe the first time in his life. Aren't you, JP?"
JAKE,"Frankly, yes, I am, and Captain, I'm sorry. But also, look, there's Ratko. Humility over. I'm amazing."
HOLT,Go.
AMY,He couldn't lock himself in. Split up and find the ones that are unlocked.
HOLT,Looks like we all got door duty.
JAKE,I see what you did there. Nice.
PARROT,I'm lonely.
JAKE,"Hang in there, buddy."
JAKE,"Hello, Ratko."
RATKO,You can't stop me. I'm going.
JAKE,"You're not going, actually. Because if you'll just take a quick peek to your right, you'll see Detectives Boyle and Diaz."
JAKE,"Over there is Detective Santiago. And behind you is Captain Holt. Can you believe that? A captain, on a stakeout! He's kind of a hands-on dude. Point is, we have you surrounded -- -- oh my God, I figured out the tie thing! Captain -- hey, I figured it out!"
HOLT,"Maybe now's not the best time, Detective."
JAKE,"It's a uniform. We're a team, and ties are part of the uniform for that team. Right."
RATKO,...You ask Ratko what team?
JAKE,"No, Ratko, shut up. It's important to you because you were kept off that team, and now you're the coach and you want us all to wear the same uniform. Boom. I nailed it."
HOLT,"Yes, you did. Now, please arrest Ratko."
JAKE,"Oh -- right. Cool. Okay, Ratko, gun down. Get on the ground and put your hands on your --"
JAKE,Ugh. I hate running.
AMY,Got him.
JAKE,"That's how we do things in the nine-nine, Captain. We catch bad guys, and we look good doing it."
HOLT,What's wrong with you?
JAKE,"Never took off the speedo. Huge mistake. It is inside me. Great job, team!"
HOLT,"And what's this all about, Detective?"
JAKE,"Oh, the tux? I'm done with work. This is how I dress in my free time."
HOLT,"You did well today, Peralta. But you're going to need a little more humility if you're going to make captain one day."
AMY,"Him?! If anyone's going to make captain in this bar, it's me. And you, Captain, because you are a captain."
JAKE,"Yeah, I don't want your job. That's the last thing I want."
HOLT,Okay. Guess I was mistaken. The beers are on him.
GINA,How'd it go with Rosa?
CHARLES,"We will not be seeing a movie. But -- and this is big -- she called me ""sweet."" Sweet's pretty good, right?"
GINA,Sweet's not good. Grow a pair.
JAKE,"Gotta give it up, Santiago took him down hard. Well done. (off her smile) It was sexy. I was very into it."
AMY,"Ugh, just when you're being sincere, you ruin everything."
JAKE,"Yeah, that's kind of my move."
TERRY,Hoo boy. So glad I was not there.
HOLT,I think you would've handled yourself just fine.
HOLT,"Every cop is different. Every precinct is different. But this is the nine-nine. You want to be on this team? You grind it. Get cases, work cases, solve cases. The right way. To the detectives of the nine-nine."
JAKE,"And to Captain Holt...'s best detective, Jake Peralta."
JAKE," Ah, Captain. You're at my desk. Just what I wanna see first thing in the morning."
HOLT," You're three minutes late, Peralta."
JAKE, Not my fault. I had a plumbing problem.
JAKE," Which reminds me, I'm gonna need a new departmentally issued phone. Oh, come on, really? I'm a few minutes late, so you're gonna call me out in front of everyone?"
HOLT," Good idea. Everyone? Gather round, so I can call out Peralta in front of you."
JAKE," Okay, fine. I was three minutes late. I'm sorry for doing one thing wrong."
HOLT," Oh, it's more than one thing."
JAKE, Uh-oh.
HOLT, Let's start with the Kristov murder.
JAKE, It was an amazing solve. I got him to confess in 20 minutes.
HOLT," You also mislabeled the evidence, so that confession is worthless if the sergeant hadn't caught your mistake. Here are three cases with sloppy paperwork. Here are two pictures. One is your locker. The other is a garbage dump in the Philippines. Can you tell which is which?"
JAKE, That one's the dump?
HOLT, They're both your locker.
JAKE," Gah, I should've guessed that. He's good."
HOLT," This folder is labeled ""undies, dirty."""
JAKE," So I won't confuse it with ""undies, clean."" Also, who cares about all these rules? I have more felony arrests than any other detective here."
HOLT, You also have more mice living in your desk than any other detective.
JAKE," ""Algernon."" ""You guys, Algernon's back."""
HOLT," Get rid of the mouse, and get your act together now."
JAKE, He's grumpy.
TERRY," Okay, detectives, let's get started. Santiago, where are we with the Jay Street drug bust?"
AMY," There are 12 keys of coke unaccounted for, but we just got a warrant to search the dealer's apartment."
TERRY, Good. Take Boyle and Diaz.
CHARLES, Dream team.
TERRY," Peralta, brief us on the vandalism case."
JAKE," Well, there's no easy way to put this, Sarge, but someone has been painting wieners on squad cars."
JAKE," And apparently, they won't stop until there's a penis drawn on every cop car in Brooklyn."
HITCHCOCK," Oh, that's what he's been drawing. But what are those little round things at the bottom?"
SCULLY, That's the butt.
JAKE, The butt?
HOLT, I assume you have a plan to catch this gentleman.
JAKE," Did you just say ""genital-man""? Because if so, kudos, and yes, I have a plan. I'm gonna plant a decoy squad car as bait. Meanwhile, I'll be waiting in an undercover vehicle here. He's already tagged three U/C vehicles."
TERRY, He can clearly spot 'em. You should take my minivan.
ROSA, A minivan? A-ha!
TERRY, You all got a problem with my minivan?
TERRY," Cause my wife doesn't like it either. She wanted an SUV, but those things roll, man. They roll!"
HOLT," That's a good idea, sergeant. We'll take the van."
JAKE," We? You're coming with me? Sir, with all due respect, I don't need backup."
HOLT, It's not backup. It's babysitting.
ROSA, Babysitting. A-ha!
CHARLES," Oh, look at this. The drug dealer got a B.A. in art history from Brooklyn college. Interesting, huh?"
ROSA, How's that interesting?
CHARLES," Well, it's surprising because you would think he had studied... drugs."
AMY, I studied art history too.
ROSA, Also not interesting.
GINA," Excuse me. I know I'm just a lowly civilian administrator, but I couldn't help overhearing you're looking for some missing drugs? As it turns out, my friend here, Carlene, is a psychic, and she's ready to help you."
CARLENE," I do palms, tarot, and I have a degree in numerology from the internet."
ROSA," Ugh. Really, Gina? A psychic?"
GINA," What? She's the real deal. E.G., last week, she predicted I would have a sensuous encounter with a guy named Mark. And I did."
GINA, Is anyone here named Mark?
GINA, You're good.
GINA," Okay, she's had visions which, frankly, science cannot account for. Also, she can get you amazing deals on ladies' footwear. She's assistant manager at Leonard's designer shoes."
CARLENE, Vision. The drugs are in a location. I see the color blue...
GINA, She sees blue.
CARLENE," And yellow. And I see the letters ""L"", ""R"", ""S"", ""T"", ""W"", ""E"", and ""B."""
AMY," So basically, everyone's first eight guesses in hangman?"
ROSA," Thank you, Carlene. Your entire life is garbage."
JAKE," So Holt's coming on my stakeout now? I made a mixtape with some very explicit rap on it, and now I can't sing along."
TERRY, You made a mixtape?
JAKE," Yes, I still listen to cassettes. This guy is all over me. I mean, a Captain on a minor vandalism case? It's insane."
TERRY," What's insane is how you refuse to get with the program. There is a new sheriff in town, Jake."
JAKE," Well, I like the old sheriff. I mean, McGintley wouldn't care about a messy desk or all these stupid rules."
ALL," Tase, tase, tase, tase, tase..."
MCGINTLEY, Hey! What the hell's going on here?
JAKE, Science experiment. I wanna see what happens if I taser this cantaloupe.
MCGINTLEY, Okay.
ALL," Tase, tase, tase, tase, tase... Aha. Oh! Yeah! "
JAKE," And McGintley wouldn't care if I was three minutes late 'cause he was always an hour late and hungover, and he would let you do literally anything you want if you gave him a hamburger."
TERRY, Did he let you play your mixtape?
JAKE, Okay. That's very funny.
TERRY," Get an iPod, man."
JAKE, Mixtape.
CHARLES," I just want to apologize for my fellow detectives' behavior. Okay, my granny also had the gift."
GRANNY, I feel that I will die soon.
CHARLES, She was right. She died two years later.
CARLENE," Your sincere belief in my gift means a great deal. Vision. The woman you love, the one you work with, the scary one with the black hair..."
CHARLES, Rosa. Yes?
CARLENE, She doesn't love you back. She will never love you back.
GINA," Say ""thank you,"" Charles. She just told you your future."
CHARLES, Thank you.
JAKE, You left without me.
HOLT, You were late again.
JAKE," Well, I had to put on my undercover minivan disguise. Say hello to Harvey Norgenbloom, CPA, recently divorced father of two with a dark sexual secret. What's your cover?"
HOLT, Angry Captain.
JAKE," Okay, so you do not like my ensemble."
HOLT, I'm just concerned that you may find it hard to pursue a criminal on foot while wearing man sandals.
JAKE," But the sandals define Harvey. He's a sandals guy. [sighs] Captain, why the babysitting? Why are you micromanaging me?"
HOLT, You think I wanna be sitting here with you instead of running my precinct?
JAKE, Yes.
HOLT," It was a rhetorical question. I've spent the last 12 years fighting for my first command, and I'm not gonna let you screw it up because you refuse to take your job seriously."
JAKE," Hey, I do take my job seriously. I put away bad guys. That's what matters."
HOLT," Well, so does doing your paperwork, showing up on time, wearing proper footwear."
JAKE, That's on Harvey. That's not me.
HOLT," Well, so here's the deal. You're gonna have a superior officer babysitting you on every one of your cases. And when you show me that you can do your job... Every part of your job... Perfectly, then I'll back off."
JAKE," Okay. Counteroffer. I give you 50 bucks, and you let me do whatever I want. Fine. We'll do it your way. From this point on, I'll do every part of the job perfectly, perfecter than perfectly."
HOLT," It's ""more perfectly."" You said that imperfectly."
JAKE, I was testing you. You did perfectly. Quick update on the tagger situation... He is currently spray-painting our van right now.
HOLT," Police, freeze!"
JAKE," Ow, ow, ow. Sandal down. Lost a sandal. NYPD, freeze! I'm here. You're busted."
HOLT, Already got him.
JAKE, We got him.
JAKE," Oh, hey, Captain. Hi, so I was able to procure that $50 after all, and my offer still stands. Let me do whatever I want, and the $40... That's how much I actually have... is yours. No? Fair enough. I only had 30 anyways. Well, I guess in order to get you to stop micromanaging me, I'm gonna have to get back to the most important piece of police work there is"
JAKE, And I'm anxious to restore my status as a lone wolf. [Howls]
HOLT," Anything else, Detective?"
JAKE," Yeah, I'm gonna do one more. [Howls] Lone wolf. He's digging me."
JAKE," Hey, Sarge, do you know where we keep the glitter? Just wanna make sure this report for the Captain is extra sparkly."
TERRY," What are you doing, Peralta?"
JAKE," Look, if I have to do things his way, I'm gonna do them my way."
TERRY," [laughs] Okay, man. It was nice working with you."
JAKE," I'm not scared of him, okay? I'm not scared of anyone. Oh, also, The Tagger drew a penis on your minivan. I'm sorry. Please don't chase after me."
TERRY, What? There's a penis on my minivan?
AMY," High ceilings, three bedrooms. Why does every perp have a nicer place than I do?"
ROSA, You know what they don't teach you at the academy? It's better to be a criminal.
CHARLES," Oh, no. The cabinets are blue."
AMY," Tacky. Not a deal breaker, though. I'd just repaint it."
CHARLES, The psychic predicted the drugs would be found in something blue.
CARLENE, I see the color blue.
CHARLES, She also made this really depressing prediction about my life.
CARLENE, She will never love you back.
CHARLES," And if she's right about where we find the drugs, that means she's right about the other thing."
AMY, Uh-huh. Kitchen. Whoa. Jackpot. There's way more than 12 keys in here.
ROSA, Where was it?
AMY," Baseboard, behind the hamper."
CHARLES, What color was the hamper?
AMY, Green.
CHARLES, Yes. The clothes hamper was green. The clothes hamper was green! Drinks on me.
ROSA, [laughs] You're weird.
JAKE," Sorry this is taking so long. Still writing up my report. Pretty detailed. Hey, Gina, can you look up what the humidity was about an hour ago and also what moon cycle we're in?"
GINA," No, sorry. Don't feel like it, no."
JAKE," Thanks, Gina. And now to you. What's your name?"
PRIVILEGED KID," My name is Banana Fartman, MD."
JAKE," I don't believe you. Come on, man. Just tell me who you are. I need to fill this thing out perfectly, so my boss will get off my back. Are you a minor? How old are you?"
PRIVILEGED KID, I'm 610. I'm a highlander.
JAKE," Okay, you know what? I'm gonna put that in there. And then you're gonna be tried as an adult highlander. And they're gonna cut your head off. Is that what you want?"
CHARLES," I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but your psychic friend's predictions about the drug case were wrong, which means all of her predictions are wrong."
GINA, Mm-mm. No way. She's never wrong.
CHARLES," We found the cocaine behind a green hamper. Never said green or the letter ""H."""
GINA," Mm-hmm, she said ""blue"" and ""yellow,"" Charles. I don't know if there's any kindergarteners present, but those two colors combined make green. She also mentioned the letters ""L"" and ""B,"" and another name for a hamper is..."
CHARLES, Lady bin?
GINA," Laundry basket. Oh, little boo-boo. Can you go be depressed over there? You're bumming out my whole area."
TERRY," Baby, I've got some bad news. Someone painted a giant penis on our minivan. No, you cannot have an SUV now. Those things roll, baby. They roll!"
JAKE," Hey, look at this. Your prints were on file. Nice to meet you, Trevor Podolski. Oh, Podolski, just like Deputy Police Commissioner Podolski. Your father is Deputy Police Commissioner Podolski."
TREVOR," I'm not sure how things work here, but does that mean that your career is in my hands?"
JAKE," Okay, you know what? Yes."
AMY, 20.2 kilos. I feel like we could round up to 21.
GINA," Or we could round down to 20, take the extra 0.2, sell it to our friends."
AMY," I'll call the D.A. Rosa, you log this in. Charles, maybe watch Gina."
ROSA, So what are you doing tonight?
CHARLES, Nothing. What about you... are doing tonight?
ROSA, Nothing.
GINA, Carlene.
CHARLES," Whelp, I hope you find something to do. I'm gonna pee. That's what I'm doing tonight. No."
HOLT," Deputy Commissioner's son, huh? His decision to target cop cars makes a lot more sense now."
JAKE," We gotta let him walk, right?"
HOLT," He defaced nine police vehicles, and you caught him red-handed. Why would you let him walk?"
JAKE," Captain, I did all the work on this perfectly. [pulls up his report] I mean, my report has over 25 pages of meticulous research, diagrams, and maps. I even put an ""About the Author"" section on the back. [flips it to show a dramatic picture of him on the back] I did everything you asked me to do. But this is above my pay grade. You gotta make the call."
HOLT," You're the arresting office. It's your call. I told you to do every part of your job, and making this call is part of your job."
JAKE," Yeah, but you think I should process him."
HOLT, Mm-hmm.
JAKE," Well, if I do, the Deputy Commissioner could ruin my career, and I'll end up on the streets selling my beautiful body for a can of beans."
HOLT, Mm-hmm.
JAKE, Has anyone ever told you you look exactly like a statue?
HOLT, Yes.
CHARLES," Man, you were totally right about the cocaine, and you were also right about Rosa."
CARLENE, Who's Rosa?
CHARLES, The woman I--
GINA, The woman who doesn't love him back.
CARLENE, Oh.
CHARLES," Yes, that woman."
CARLENE," You know, it can be a burden to always know what's gonna happen in the future."
CARLENE, Don't get out of the chair! I just had a vision of you leaving this chair and getting seriously injured.
CHARLES," Oh, my god."
GINA, I should probably wheel you back to your desk.
CARLENE, That is a great idea.
GINA," Wheel you off a bridge. I'm kidding. Oh, you're alone. Uh-oh, you're alone for life."
JAKE," So here are my options. One, I process Podolski's kid, he fires me, and I spend the rest of my career as a detective, third grade, which is literally pathetic. No offense, Hitchcock."
HITCHCOCK, None taken.
JAKE," Option two, I let him walk, and I spend the rest of my life with Holt as my babysitter. Honestly, when I think about spending the rest of my life with a babysitter, she's kind of a cute blond named Erica, and she always has pizza money and lets me stay up as late as I want."
AMY, How old are you in this scenario?
JAKE," Anyway, the point is Holt cares more about whether I ""do my job right"" than whether I have a job at all. So I'm taking suggestions."
AMY," I say piss off Holt, so we get to watch your career end right in front of us."
JAKE," Okay, thank you for that, Santiago. [turns to his whiteboard and puts a mark under dont arrest'] I'm gonna put you down for ""don't arrest,"" and I'm also going to put your phone number on every urinal in Rikers."
ROSA," Don't arrest him. Just smack him. Hard. With a phone book on a body part no one can see, you know what I'm saying?"
JAKE, So you're suggesting police brutality?
ROSA," Ha, ha, I guess so, yeah. Why?"
JAKE," Hey, Scully."
SCULLY, Yeah?
JAKE," You want this collar? Paperwork's all done, and it's perfect."
SCULLY, The Podolski kid? Are you kidding? I just gave him my lunch.
JAKE," Okay. Boyle, what do you think?"
CHARLES," I don't know, man. I'm lost. The universe is a cruel and vexing puzzle. I-I'm at the whim of the cosmos."
JAKE," Alright, I'm gonna put you down for ""bummer."" And you can hang out in that category all by yourself."
GINA," Hey, everyone. Hey, Jake, there is a very sexy, angry official here, Deputy Commissioner Podolski. He's asking for you. Very angry. Elderly, sexy, furious. [walks away]"
JAKE," Well, my career is over. See you at the bottom, Hitchcock. No offense."
HITCHCOCK," No, none taken."
JAKE, Deputy Commissioner.
PODOLSKI, Where's my son?
JAKE," He is at my desk, enjoying a nice glass of bubbly water and some chocolate I was saving for a special occasion."
AMY," Hey, Peralta, when you're done, can you help me wrap up this massive cocaine bust I just pulled off? Thanks. Oh, Deputy Commissioner, didn't see you there. Sorry for interrupting. Amy Santiago."
PODOLSKI," Trevor, what'd you do this time?"
TREVOR, Nothing.
PODOLSKI, There you have it. He said he did nothing.
JAKE, So I caught him red-handed doing nothing?
PODOLSKI, I'm saying maybe it's a possibility you made a mistake.
JAKE," You know, normally, I would agree with you, but I've been pretty detail-oriented the last few hours."
PODOLSKI," You might not understand this, but Trevor is a special kid. He makes straight A's. He's going to Duke next year. Lacrosse scholarship."
JAKE, Oh.
PODOLSKI," Sometimes, boys just need to be boys."
JAKE," You do realize he did thousands of dollars worth of property damage, though, to police vehicles."
PODOLSKI," Look, I think we can all agree that I'm ordering you to let this slide because nothing happened. This is officially out of your hands."
JAKE," Would you actually mind just checking out my report? It's pretty thorough, and I spent over an hour on fonts. Kinda snazzy, so…"
PODOLSKI," Oh, thank you. I'll get right to it."
JAKE, Thanks.
PODOLSKI," Trevor, let's go."
JAKE, Have a good one.
CHARLES, Choo. [opens fridge] Yes.
ROSA, What's up with the chair?
CHARLES," Um, Carlene predicted if I get out of this chair, I'd get badly hurt, so I'm not chancing it. Oh, man. There's no more pudding cups left."
CHARLES, Ah! What'd you do that for?
ROSA," There. Now you're hurt in this chair. You can get hurt anywhere, Boyle. And if you do, it won't be because some shoe salesman predicted it. You make your own destiny."
JAKE," Well, we don't have to worry about Podolski's son anymore. The case is officially out of my hands. No charges filed."
HOLT, Why is there yogurt on this?
JAKE," The Deputy Commissioner threw my report in Terry's trash can, and he'd been eating yogurt earlier."
HOLT, Terry loves yogurt. Something wrong?
JAKE," Kinda, yeah. I called six precincts about this kid. He's been brought in a dozen times. Theft, vandalism, drunken disorderly, but he's never been processed. His daddy comes in and bails him out every time. He's a lucky little jerk."
HOLT," No, I wouldn't say he was lucky. I feel bad for this kid. I mean, what kind of father cares so little for his son that he lets him get away with everything? Well, he's someone else's problem now. Like you said, it's out of your hands."
JAKE," Alright, I see what you're trying to do, but it's not gonna work. I'm not going to arrest him. I'm going to arrest him!"
HOLT, You want backup?
JAKE, Yes.
PODOLSKI, What is this? You can't do this. Get that thing out of here.
JAKE," Excuse me, sir. Trevor Podolski, you're under arrest for vandalism and destruction of property."
TREVOR, What--Dad!
PODOLSKI," What are you doing? I told you to back off, Peralta."
JAKE," First off, the name's Santiago, Detective Amy Santiago. Second, I'm arresting your son, which, as I say it aloud, seems like an unwise choice, but it's the one I'm making. Once again, my name is Amy Santiago."
PODOLSKI," You're being stupid, Peralta. Don't be stupid. I can make your life miserable."
HOLT," Commissioner, please don't talk to my detective in that tone. If you have a complaint, you can take it up with me."
PODOLSKI," You just made yourself a very powerful enemy, Holt. I'm gonna be watching you, both of you, like a hawk."
HOLT," You're gonna have to try a little harder if you wanna scare me. I've been an openly gay cop since 1987, so you're not the first superior officer to threaten me. You know how I'm still standing here? Cause I do my job, and I do it right. [walks back to police car]"
JAKE," Damn, son!"
HOLT," Don't say ""son."""
JAKE," Sorry. Deputy Commissioner, if you wanna pick Trevor up, he'll be at the Nine-Nine. [walks back to police car] Let's go, Fartman."
CHARLES," Carlene was wrong, Gina. Rosa said it herself-- I'm in charge of my own destiny. That means she wants me to make a move."
GINA," Mm, but Carlene was also right. You did get hurt cause Rosa punched you. And the fact that Rosa punched you means she does not like you."
CHARLES," No, no, she punched me to prove Carlene wrong."
ROSA, Move.
GINA," Oh, wait, I take it back. She definitely is into you. So much chemistry."
CHARLES," I know, it's crazy."
HOLT," Alright, let's get this meeting started."
JAKE, I'm not late. I'm here.Right on time.
HOLT," You're out of uniform, Peralta."
JAKE," Baby steps, Captain. Baby steps."
AMY," For the last time, the best cop movies, in order: Training Day, Lethal Weapon, and Fargo. End of discussion."
JAKE, Wrong. Die Hard is the best cop movie of all time. One cop heroically saving the day while everyone else stands around and watches. It's the story of my life.
CHARLES," I like Turner & Hooch. Tom Hanks, reluctant friendship with a dog. That hits me where I live."
ROSA, No. Robocop. It's got everything I like--gratuitous violence.
JAKE," Oh, I thought you were listing things."
ROSA, I was. I'm done.
JAKE, Okay.
GINA," Let's talk Bad Boys. That's the perfect cop movie. Mr. Smith, lookin' fine. A hot cup of tea leone. Come on."
TERRY, Francois Truffaut's Breathless. What? Terry likes foreign films.
JAKE," Mm-kay. There is a correct answer to this question, though. So gather around for the greatest cop film of all time. Please refrain from texting during our presentation. [clicks something on his computer and video feed pops up] All right, so there's Hitchcock. And there's an old hooker. There it is!"
HITCHCOCK," Come on, guys, that happened four years ago."
JAKE," Shh, this is the best part. She comes back, takes the wallet and here she goes!"
JAKE," Hey, love the sweater. Who you slayin' tonight, lady killer?"
CHARLES," Well, we shall see what we shall see."
JAKE," No, you're dressed exactly like The Lady Killer. "
CHARLES, Damn it! This is Jeffrey Dahmer's corduroys all over again.
TERRY," All right, let's get started. Scully. Where are you on digitizing the old case files?"
SCULLY," As of yesterday, I'm officially 1% done."
TERRY, Why are you smiling? That's nothin'.
SCULLY," There's thousands of cases, and for each one, I have to fill out 200 little box thingies on 50 different screens."
ROSA, At least you get to sit on your butt all day.
SCULLY, That's actually the worst part. My doctor said I have an anal canyon.
JAKE," Ugh, god, Scully. Why are you always telling us about your disgusting body?"
JAKE, I don't see anything.
SCULLY, That's because it's all wart.
JAKE, How are you married?
HOLT," Peralta, where are we on the Adams Street burglary?"
JAKE," We are very close, Captain. Aside from a complete absence of evidence, suspects, or leads. So, in conclusion, not at all close."
HOLT, And the Vickers Street aggravated assault?
JAKE," Stalled out, and the Calloway robbery also remains unsolved.. Due to a lack of solving it by me."
GINA, Sounds like someone's in a little bit of a slump.
JAKE, I'm not in a slump.
AMY, You're not?
JAKE," I don't slump, people. I opposite slump. I p-muls. That's ""slump"" backwards, and it's what I do. I p-muls all over this bitch."
TERRY, Dismissed.
AMY, Slump.
JAKE, P-muls!
JAKE," Wait...Before you say anything, I want to guess what happened, based on your face. Someone died. No! You won a prize! I'm not getting better at this."
HOLT, I'm concerned that the open cases mound of garbage on your desk has become so much higher than the closed cases mound of garbage.
JAKE," All right, sir. Let me hit you with a little analogy. Are you familiar with racecars?"
HOLT, Formula 1 or Stock?
JAKE," That's already way more than I know about it. The point is, I'm a super-awesome race car who's hit a couple of unlucky speed bumps."
HOLT, You got speed bumps on a race track?
JAKE," Is that not part of car racing? It should be. All I'm saying is, it's open road again. I'm about to close a case. Missing grandma Helen Sterrino. Last Sunday, her grandson Judd reported she went out for bagels and never came back. [hands report to Holt] This morning, we picked up an old lady matching her description exactly. I showed her pictures of Judd, and she said, and I quote, [imitating old lady] 'That's my grandson.'"
HOLT, What did I say about doing voices?
JAKE," I'm a storyteller, sir. It's my craft. [takes report back from Holt] Anyways, grandson's coming in. They reunite, and I throw another case on the old ""Solved it"" pile. [puts file on a stack of other files and it falls off his desk] Hey my croissant. [picks up croissant that was under the stacks of papers then bangs it on the desk, showing it's rock solid, and proceeds to eat it]"
AMY," You wanted to see me, Captain?"
HOLT," Yes, the D. A. wanted me to personally thank you for your work on the Jay Street drug bust."
AMY," That's why we do this, sir."
HOLT, For praise?
AMY, Uh...
HOLT, There's a community outreach program that's very important to me. I was wondering if you'd like to head it up.
AMY," Absolutely, sir. I won't just head it up, I will head and shoulders it up. I will dive in, swim around it, and just be altogether good with it."
HOLT, Be more articulate when you speak to the children.
AMY," Yes, sir, I will make better mouth."
CHARLES," Hey, Sarge, I need someone to fill out a lineup. Will you be Scary Terry?"
TERRY," Oh, I love being Scary Terry. He says what regular Terry's thinking."
TERRY, This is takin' too long! I'm gonna miss the farmer's market!
TERRY," But I'm too busy. I've got a special case I'm working on. Uh, Hitchcock, Boyle needs you to fill out a lineup."
HITCHCOCK," Oh, great. I'll take my shirt off."
CHARLES, No one asked you to take your shirt off. Stop volunteering to take your shirt off.
HITCHCOCK, I can't hear you! Shirt's over my ears.
AMY," Hi, Rosa. Ooh, I like your shoes. They're a really pretty--"
ROSA, What do you need?
AMY," --Color. Okay. You know how, every year, the precinct does that junior police program seminar?"
ROSA, That thing where we try to get a bunch of loser kids to become student snitches?
AMY," No, the thing where we try to get at-risk kids--"
ROSA, Losers.
AMY, To sign up to become junior police officers.
ROSA, Snitches. What about it?
AMY, Captain specifically asked me to run it this year. I signed you up to do it with me. Here's the info. [handing packet to Rosa]
ROSA, Now I gotta read something?
GINA, Greetings. Fine. I guess I can help you with those at-risk kids.
AMY," [scoffs] I don't need your help. It's nothing personal. It's just... You're not a cop, so I'm not really sure you could help."
GINA, Okay. No hard feelings. But I hate you. Not joking. Bye.
JAKE," Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Terrino. I'm glad you're here. May I present to you... [imitates trumpet fanfare while showing the family the old lady]"
OLD LADY," Oh, my darlings. Thank god I found you. Oh, look at those beautiful cheeks."
MR. TERRINO, I have no idea who this lady is. I've never seen her before in my life.
JAKE," What? No, she recognized you. This is Helen."
OLD LADY, Who's Helen? Oh! That's my husband. Solomon. [hugs Charles]
CHARLES, I'm--I'm not really her husband.
OLD LADY, You're so much shorter than you used to be. What did the Japanese do to you?
JAKE, Different generation.
CHARLES," Okay, this is Ethel Musterberg from the Prospect Heights Senior Center. There was an I.D. card in her back pocket."
TERRY, Why was your hand in her back pocket?
JAKE," Well, she told me she didn't have any I.D., and unlike Boyle, my first instinct was not to caress her butt."
CHARLES, Frisked! I frisked her butt!
HOLT," It looks like this case remains unsolved, Peralta."
JAKE," Oh, my god. I'm in a slump!"
JAKE," Oh, cool. You're all here in the break room."
ROSA, You asked us to come in here.
JAKE," What? Here's a hypothetical question. Let's say I knew someone that, for the first time in their career, was experiencing, like, a minor slump. What do you think you would suggest to that person if they were going through that?"
CHARLES," Well, I haven't really been in a slump since my divorce. So I'd tell this person, ""Maybe get divorced."" He'd have to get married first."
JAKE," Okay, so the suggestion to beat is get married and then divorced. Rosa?"
ROSA," Fly to Montreal, hit a classy hotel bar, bone a stranger, slump over."
JAKE," Wow, that sounds amazing."
ROSA, Yeah.
JAKE," That's a good one. Sarge, what would you do?"
TERRY," 10,000 sit-ups."
JAKE," Okay, do you have a backup plan in case my hypothetical person can only do 9,500, or 3?"
HOLT, What's going on in here?
CHARLES, We're helping Jake's friend get out of his slump.
HOLT," Or try working a case until it's solved, Peralta. I always find that closing cases is the best way to end the slump."
JAKE," Thank you, Captain!"
TERRY," He's right. You just need a win. Pick your easiest, no-brainer case, and work it till it's done."
JAKE, Fine! Right after I do Rosa's Montreal sex thing. That sounds fun.
ROSA, Yeah.
AMY," Okay, this is the Junior Police Program. AKA ""Mission Possible."" [clicks something and the TV starts playing spy music] Your mission, should you choose to accept it, [pointing at the kids as she walks back and forth] is to get your life back on track."
GINA, [coughs] Narc!
AMY," Hey, Gina. What are you doing?"
GINA," Oh, hi, Amy. Since I have nothing to offer, and since I'm not a cop, I thought I'd just show up and learn."
AMY, Do you wanna help me out here?
ROSA," Nah, I think I'm good."
AMY," I know you think getting in trouble is cool. But let me show you what can happen if you continue down this path. [using a different voice] Hey, yo, I'm an at-risk kid, and I think it's cool to sell drugs."
KID, Hold up--Why does the kid selling drugs sound like he's black?
AMY, He's not.
GINA," Well, why not? Are you saying that black people can't sell drugs?"
AMY," No, I'm not saying that."
KID, We have a black president. Why can't black people sell drugs?
AMY, I'm so confused.
GINA, Black people can sell drugs!
TERRY, [muffled grunting] Don't make me hit you again.
TERRY, Um...I'm building this dollhouse for my girls. It's their birthday tomorrow. I told my wife I'd get it done.
CHARLES, I had the same exact one when I was a kid!
LITTLE GIRL," Mom, Charles is hogging my doll house!"
KID CHARLES, Grandma bought it for the both of us!
CHARLES," You want some help, big man?"
TERRY," No! I can do this. It's just driving me a little crazy. Where do I affix the princess tower, Boyle?! Where do I affix it?!"
CHARLES, On the side of the turret--
TERRY," Not now, Boyle. Let a brother breathe. Let a brother breathe."
HITCHCOCK, Why would I swap cases with you? I got multiple calls that a guy in the Sackett Towers is dealing meth out of his apartment. It's a guaranteed arrest.
JAKE," And therefore will have a ton of paperwork. Which I know you hate. I have a murder here with no leads and no evidence. It's unsolvable, and thus... shall have no paperwork."
HITCHCOCK," You had me at ""No paperwork."""
JAKE," That was the very end of the sentence. All right, Boyle. Let's hit it."
HOLT," So, where are you going, Peralta?"
JAKE," I am on my way to ending the slump. I got a dunker, Captain. Nothin' but net."
CHARLES," Hey, slump, you're about to get nailed by the Jake Hammer."
HOLT," So you haven't solved any of your old cases, and yet you've taken on a new one. I mean, shouldn't you at least solve this Helen Sterrino missing grandmother case first?"
JAKE," Or I could solve a super easy one, get my mojo back, and move on to catching The Zodiac Killer. Am I getting ahead of myself?"
CHARLES," No, you are not, Jake Rabbit."
JAKE, I like Jake Hammer better. Let's go. Ah.
AMY, I did not think getting these kids to sign up would be this hard.
ROSA, [scoffs] These kids don't wanna listen to you. You're like... Smart and articulate.
AMY, So are you! Why am I offended by that?
ROSA," They don't identify with you because you're not from the streets. I am. Follow, watch, learn. All right, listen up. [rips earbuds out of two girls ears] I know you think you're badasses. But deep down, you're scared. How do I know? Because I've been that same scared kid, and if you don't get your crap together, I'm gonna end up busting you and throwing you in jail. Got it?"
KID," Remix, yo!"
ROSA, What's happening?
AMY, I think they're laughing at you.
ROSA, That's never happened before. I don't like it.
JAKE," NYPD, hands where I can see them."
OLD MAN," Don't shoot! I was just practicing my minuets, but I'll hold it down."
JAKE," All right, flute man, who else is in this apartment? Where's the dealer?"
FLUTE MAN, I live here alone with my birds.
JAKE," What, you don't think I know this M.O.? These are mules. They're drug mules. They're bird mule drugs. Drug bird mules."
CHARLES, Apartment's clear.
JAKE, We got multiple calls about a dealer here.
FLUTE MAN," I bet it's the silly kids down the hall. They love prank calling me. The only drugs in this apartment are for my heart, my liver, my kidney, my salivary glands, and my penis and my feet."
CHARLES," Oh, bird pooped on your shoulder. No, wait... Pooped on your head, then dripped onto your shoulder."
CHARLES," I'm telling you, it's good luck."
JAKE," No, it isn't, okay? That's just something people say when a bird poops on you to make you feel better because it's terrible."
HITCHCOCK," Fore, comin' in!"
JAKE," Oh, come on."
HITCHCOCK," I was at the crime scene. This guy comes up out of nowhere, confesses. Well, he says he's gotta make things right, so helps me track down his accomplices."
JAKE," That is so great, man. Looks like everything's comin' up Hitchcock."
GINA," Hey, Jake. You busy?"
JAKE," Yes, I very clearly am busy."
GINA, The medical examiner's office just called. They mishandled some evidence. So the D.A.'s gonna have to dismiss your last two busts.
JAKE, [sighs] Great. And the slump gets worse.
GINA," I don't think it's a slump. Honestly, you are straight-up cursed."
JAKE," Good to know. Can you hand me a paper towel, please, Gina?"
GINA, There's no more left.
JAKE," Yeah, that sounds right."
JAKE, Hey.
HOLT, You're dripping on my carpet.
JAKE," Oh, don't worry, sir. It's just urinal water. Clean urinal water."
CHARLES, You could eat off his shirt.
HOLT, Why would I ever eat off his shirt?
JAKE," Look, sir, I don't know what's going on, but I think I'm cursed."
HOLT," Cursed, huh?"
JAKE," The freakiest things have been happening to me. I mean, I can't solve a case to save my life. Birds are unloading on me left and right. And, two seconds ago..."
JAKE," Hey, Sarge, do we have any old t-shirts in here?"
JAKE, Cursed.
HOLT," Yeah, I've seen this kind of thing before. It happened to a friend of mine back in the 1-8. Detective Smith. We called him Smitty. He thought he was cursed, and because cops are superstitious, the whole precinct thought he was cursed."
JAKE," But then he found a case, and he solved it. And now he's married to Kate Upton."
HOLT," No. No one would go out on calls with him. He responded to a riot at a gym without backup, and got beaten up by a girls' volleyball team. It was actually quite violent."
CHARLES, Man... Girls are so scary.
HOLT," I don't want you out in the field again, Peralta. I'm pulling you from casework. You can digitize old files with Scully."
JAKE," You're benching me? No, no, no, look-- I've got a plan. Give all my open cases to Hitchcock, who's suddenly on a roll, and assign me 20 fresh ones. Eventually, my luck will turn."
HOLT," No, I don't think that's what's best for you or the squad. Not until this blows over."
JAKE, And how long will that be?
HOLT," Could be a week, could be a month."
CHARLES," Could be a year. Could be a decade. Sorry, we're just saying bigger and bigger numbers."
AMY," I don't know how to connect with these kids. They're mean and shallow and respect nothing. I mean, what kind of person would they even listen to?"
GINA," Hitchcock, stop bringing your food in little tupperware containers. It hurts my fingers when I'm trying to open it."
HITCHCOCK, Sorry!
AMY," Hey, Gina. That's a super cute--"
GINA, What do you want?
AMY, --Sweater. Okay. Rosa and I think it would be great if you talked to the kids.
GINA," Mm, I thought only cops could help."
ROSA," In this case, not being a cop might actually be better."
GINA," Mm, that's true. In all cases, cops are the worst."
JAKE," ""Enter the numbers from this report into the corresponding boxes on the screen. Then fill out these fields."" And I'm in a coma. Hey, Hitchcock. Help me out, man. I'm so bored. Let me jump back on that murder with you."
HITCHCOCK, No. I got it.
JAKE," Come on, man, let me just--"
HITCHCOCK," No, don't touch it! You're contagious. Everything could fall apart!"
HOLT," Peralta, leave Hitchcock alone! Come here. I got in touch with Smitty. He says that you should rub this rabbit's foot with your left forefinger and your pinky, like this, for good luck. Okay? Now you try it."
JAKE," Okay. Yep. It's definitely helping. I can feel it. The curse is lifting off of me. Ah, hand cramp!"
HOLT," Rub, rub, rub."
CHARLES, You okay?
TERRY, The fairy princess castle has defeated me. I'm a grown man with man hands and a man brain. I should be able to put together a dollhouse in less than four hours. Why does it have to be so hard? Look... This screw has three point sides. And nowhere to screw it in! [screw clatters to floor] And there's wheels. What kind of castle has wheels? [screams as he starts destroying what's left of the castle]
JAKE," 117A. Yes. 117B. Yes. 118A. Wait a minute. Hey, just heading to the can."
HOLT, Take the rabbit's foot.
JAKE, Roger that.
CHARLES, Hey. What's going on?
JAKE," Well, I'm not allowed to leave my desk, so we have to meet in here."
CHARLES, So what you're saying is that this is kind of a...
JAKE," No, for the last time, Charles, we don't need a clubhouse."
CHARLES, You know what I'm thinking?
JAKE, No clubhouse.
JAKE," I need you to make these calls for me. Don't let Holt see you. But if my hunch is right, the slump is over. Come through for me, Boyle."
CHARLES, You know I will.
JAKE, All right.
CHARLES," I'm just saying, put a couple leather chairs in here."
JAKE, Go!
GINA," Children, your problem is not that you're troubled or at-risk or bad dressers. Is that a trucker hat? Still? Come on. Your problem... is that you don't have passion for anything. My life turned around when I found my passion. And today, well I hope to inspire you with it. [clicks to turn on Christina Aguilera's Beautiful and she starts dancing, after a while she shuts off the music and sits on the table] What are we thinking? Yes, in the denim."
KID #2, I think I speak for everyone when I say your weird dancing was just weird.
GINA," Fine. Cops make $52,000 a year. You never have to stop at a red light. And you get to carry a gun. Who wants in? Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Yes."
AMY," Oh, my god. You got eight kids to sign up. How did you know that would work?"
GINA, That's what made me sign up when I was a kid.
ROSA, You did this program?
GINA, Mm-hmm. Yeah. It does not work.
CHARLES, They're here.
JAKE, Fantastic. Too dramatic?
CHARLES, No.
JAKE, Hi.
MR. TERRINO, Why are we in the bathroom?
JAKE," I thought you might ask that, and I will answer in due time. But first, I know what happened to your grandma. Nothing."
MR. TERRINO, What are you talking about?
JAKE," The reason I couldn't find her is because she never existed. I had Detective Boyle make some calls, and it turns out you've done this before. Five missing persons reports in five different states. [hands Mr. Terrino the reports] Recognize this?"
MR. TERRINO, What are you accusing us of?
JAKE," Probably insurance fraud. Definitely filing a false report and obstruction of justice. Now, you were wondering why we did this in the bathroom. It's because you're full of crap."
CHARLES, Blammo! Jake Hammer strikes again.
JAKE, Jake Hammer strikes again.
HOLT, Detectives. I see we got eight recruits for the Junior Police Program. Outstanding.
AMY," Thank you, sir. But, as important as your praise is to me, it should actually go to Gina. She's the one that got through to the kids."
GINA," Yes, I am amazing. And I only ask for one thing in repayment. A 600% raise."
HOLT," Or... I can give you a zero percent raise and make you my personal assistant, which is what I'm doing. I think you have hidden talents, which will make you surprisingly good at the job."
GINA," No, I have no talents."
HOLT, You start Monday.
GINA, Ugh. Constantly getting Holt's approval is the worst.
AMY," Yes, I can only imagine."
JAKE," Well, the curse is over. The slump is done. Jake is back. Permission to take a selfie of the two of us, sir? [holds out phone in front of both their faces]"
HOLT, Permission denied.
JAKE," Too late. Ah, that was a good one."
HOLT," So, the rabbit's foot worked, huh?"
JAKE," Ah, maybe. All I know is my mind was so numb from doing all that boring data entry that my brain kind of rebooted, and I had an inspiration about one of my old cases. [deep breath] And I now see that that was your plan all along. And that you're capable of smiling."
HOLT," All talented detectives haves their ups and downs, Peralta."
JAKE, So you think I'm talented. You said it. No takebacks.
HOLT, You know why Boyle doesn't slump?
JAKE, Because his whole life is a slump?
HOLT," Because he doesn't let adversity get him down. He keeps grinding. If I'd given you those new cases, the second you hit a snag, you would have spiraled again. You need to stay out of your own head."
JAKE," Okay. But, sir, I don't get it. If that was your plan, why bother with Smitty and the rabbit's foot?"
HOLT," Well, there's a very good reason for that. I was, uh, I believe the term is, uh... messing with you."
JAKE," Oh... I see what's going on here. We're becoming homies. Office Christmas card candidate, right here! Me and Holt are homies!"
CHARLES," Hey, Sarge. I assembled the castle for you. Here it is."
TERRY," Oh, my god. What happened to all the princess flourishes?"
CHARLES," Well, they were destroyed, so I turned it into a princess police station. You know, some jobs take brains, some jobs take muscles, some jobs take dainty little fingers. Did I ever tell you I had to wear a woman's wedding ring?"
TERRY," Thank you, Boyle. I appreciate it."
CHARLES," You're a good dad. Don't put so much pressure on yourself. Oh, check this out. Working siren. [flicks a switch and a siren starts blaring] I'll fix that!"
AMY, I'm so glad we could finally do this.
DATE," I know, Kylie says you're always stuck at the precinct."
AMY," Yeah. Speaking of, this is work. Sorry. What's up, Peralta?"
JAKE, Captain called. He needs everybody back. There's a lead on the nightingale strangler.
AMY, Okay.
JAKE," His M.O. is he finds lonely women with no friends, poisons their food, and then guts 'em in his van. It's pretty gnarly. Last seen wearing a salmon shirt, grey blazer, and witnesses have said he has trouble fitting lettuce in his mouth."
AMY, Okay. Where are you?
JAKE," Apparently has the world's smallest pen1s and doesn't know how to use it... Hi, there, I'm Jake Peralta, Amy's boss. That's not true."
AMY, What are you doing here?
JAKE, I'm here on a date. Who is now leaving. Worth it. Have a great night.
DATE, Your boss seems really nice.
AMY, He's not my boss.
JAKE," Yes, I am!"
JAKE," And with a record five felonies solved in one week, Peralta pulls ahead. Did you guys hear that I solved five felonies in a week?"
AMY, We heard.
JAKE, Really? How?
JAKE," Five felonies in one week! Light 'em up, Boyle."
JAKE, That's the sweet taste of triumph.
ROSA, You should shower more.
JAKE, Yep.
TERRY, Updates on open cases.
CHARLES, I just got a DOA on Bessimer street.
TERRY," You're the primary, you're in charge. Take Diaz and Peralta."
BOYLE, Yes. My fantasy threesome. Of cops on a case.
HOLT," Detectives, our monthly crime statistics are due. I want all paperwork on your closed cases by tomorrow. Scully, you can just write ""I didn't close any"" on a piece of paper."
SCULLY, You got it.
AMY," I already got my paperwork in, Captain."
CAPTAIN HOLT, Then I guess this little reminder isn't for you.
JAKE," Wow, looks like he hates you even more than me."
AMY," No, he doesn't. We have a good relationship. We're on the same page."
HOLT," Something to share with the rest of us, Santiago?"
AMY," No, sir, I wasn't... Peralta was the one that was talking. God, you must have been the worst fourth grader ever."
HOLT, Joke's on you. I skipped fourth grade.
HOLT," Santiago, anything else?"
SANTIAGO, No.
HOLT, No?
AMY, Uh-uh.
HOLT, Dismissed.
AMY," Hey, Boyle. I know you haven't had Peralta as a secondary in a while. Be careful. It can be rough."
JAKE," Hey, saboteur, that's not true."
JAKE, I happen to be a very good secondary.
AMY, So you were just borrowing those cars?
PERALTA, Ask about his bank account. Ask about his bank account! Ask him about his bank...
AMY," You can't give up control, you're terrible at taking your primary's orders, you just do whatever you want. I could go on and on and on."
JAKE, Is something no lover of yours has ever said.
BOYLE, Blammo.
JAKE," Look, I can be an amazing secondary and I'll prove it."
CHARLES," I know you will, Jake-in-the-box."
JAKE," Okay, don't ever call me that again. I'm driving. We should leave now. Carry my bag. But you should pick the music, primary."
AMY," It's a great picture, sir."
HOLT, I hate it.
AMY," Me too. So I have an eyewitness in the purse-snatcher case. Only problem is, the sketch artist is out sick. How do you want me to proceed?"
HOLT," Figure it out, Santiago. It's your case."
AMY, Yes. I will do that. Thank you.
HOLT, Are you bowing?
AMY, No. This is how I walk.
ROSA," What do you need, Quasimodo? I gotta go meet with Boyle and Peralta."
AMY, Is there something wrong with the Captain? It seems like he's in a bad mood.
ROSA, I don't know. Who can tell?
ROSA," You all right, Captain? Tough weekend?"
HOLT, I went to Barbados with my husband. We wove hats out of Palm fronds and swam with the stingrays. I've never been happier.
ROSA, Guy's impossible to read. Don't even try.
JAKE, Wow. This guy must have weighed 500 pounds. I think we have an idea what killed him. Spoiler alert
JAKE & CHARLES BOTH, What do we got?
JAKE," Sorry, sorry. You're the primary, you're in charge."
OFFICER," Frank Patterson. 58 years old, married, no children. Wife found him this morning and called it in."
ROSA,"What are you thinking, Boyle?"
CHARLES, All ri...
JAKE," I'm calling natural causes. We got heart medicine over here, home defibrillator. And a frequent customer gift basket from the cardiac wing of Brooklyn Methodist. This case is open and shut. Just like his mouth was, constantly. That was my last fat joke. Okay? Diaz, check and see if there's any more meds in the bathroom. Boyle, see what you can find in the bedroom. I'll take the kitchen."
CHARLES," Yep, that's exactly what I was gonna say. It's... it's so weird. He's so good at knowing what I'm gonna tell him to do, he just does it. It's weird."
AMY," Hey, sergeant. You know how you're really good at doodling?"
TERRY," I know you think you're complimenting me, but calling them doodles is an insult. You a big fan of Picasso's doodles?"
AMY, Sorry. Can you please draw a perp for me? The sketch artist is out sick and the Captain wants this done right away. He's in a bad mood.
TERRY, Is he? I can never read him.
TERRY," You look chipper, Captain. You have a fun weekend?"
HOLT, There was a small fire in my home. I lost many photo albums of treasured memories. I'm devastated.
CHARLES, Any signs of forced entry or a struggle?
OFFICER, No.
JAKE, You sure about that? Looks like maybe his belt had a pretty epic struggle with his stomach.
AMY," I'm telling you, he and I have a connection and there is something bothering him. Can you help me out?"
AMY," Great. Ma'am, can you please describe the perp to sergeant Jeffords?"
LADY," Yeah, he had, um, dark, curly hair, and a neck tattoo..."
TERRY," Wait, wait, wait. Slow down. Let's start with the eyes. Were they desperate? Lonely? Did they betray heartache?"
LADY, They were brown.
TERRY, Do you even want your purse back?
ROSA, So far you've managed to tell three fat jokes and completely bulldoze Charles. Is that your idea of being a good secondary?
JAKE," First off, I've told four. And second, I'm helping. I mean, I started cataloguing the contents of the fridge, but it turns out there's not enough paper on earth. Five fat jokes. Thanks, Arnie. [Laughs] See, Arnie thinks I'm doing great."
ROSA," Arnie, shut up. Jake, for once, just hang back and let Boyle do his job."
JAKE," Fine. Unless I get a direct order from Boyle I will stand here motionless like a wise, old oak tree."
ROSA, You look like an idiot.
CHARLES," I'm so sorry for your loss, Mrs. Patterson. Can you talk about what happened after breakfast?"
MRS.PATTERSON," I took the dog for a walk. When I came back, he was dead. I'm just in shock. We were going on a cruise together next week. He had pre-purchased the unlimited soda package."
CHARLES, I'm sure the soft drink industry mourns his passing.
JAKE, Motion reactivated. Hey. Detective Jake Peralta.
M.E, Dr. Rossi. I'm the new medical examiner. Don't let me get in your way. I'm sure you have a lot to do.
JAKE," Actually, I've been given a direct order to do nothing, so. What brings you here... Okay. All right. Sorry. Sorry."
DR.ROSSI, You all right?
JAKE, What's up?
HOLT, How's the Patterson case looking?
BOYLE," It looks like natural causes, but I'll know for sure once I get the autopsy results tomorrow. Jake volunteered to follow up with the M.E. My man is all over it."
DR.ROSSI, I'm really glad you could sneak away from your case.
JAKE," Well, it's technically not really my case, but on the plus side, I have all the time in the world."
ROSSI, Oh.
JAKE," To you. And to the ginormous, dead fat man who brought us together."
BOYLE," Hey, Jake. Have you heard anything from the M.E.? She hasn't sent the autopsy report."
JAKE," Oh, that's strange. Maybe probably a bunch more people died and she got super busy? That's definitely what happened."
CHARLES," Okay, just let me know when she calls. You got it."
JAKE," Hey, can I ask you guys something? Can you keep a secret?"
ROSA, Do you know anything about my life?
JAKE," No, I do not. Good point. Okay, so you know the new medical examiner? I kinda had s*x with her last night."
AMY, What?
JAKE," Oh, sorry, I forgot who I was talking to. s*x is something that two adults do with their bodies when they're attracted to each other."
ROSA," He's right, Santiago. Do you not know that?"
AMY," I meant, what were you thinking? She was supposed to be doing an autopsy for your primary, Charles."
JAKE," The guy died of natural causes. What's the big deal? Anyways, back to last night. As you would imagine, I'm normally up for pretty much anything in the bedroom, but I can't tell if what happened was weird or sexy."
ROSSI, Wait. Close your eyes.
JAKE," Oh, okay."
ROSSI," Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh."
JAKE, What are you doing?
ROSSI, rI like 'em cold.
JAKE, Okay...
ROSA, Not that weird.
JAKE, Cold? Like a dead guy?
AMY, You're reading into that.
JAKE, Am I?
ROSSI, You have a really nice chest.
JAKE, Thank you.
ROSSI, I'd love to crack it open and get my hands all over your organs.
JAKE, Okay...
ROSSI, I wonder how much your appendix weighs. [Gasps] Oh. It's inflamed.
JAKE," All right. Wait, that's bad, right?"
ROSSI," Yeah, it is. Oh, no."
AMY, Ew! Please tell me you ran out of there.
JAKE, No. For some reason I kinda started getting into it.
ROSSI," Oh, what do we have here?"
JAKE, A 34-year-old caucasian male who is dead. Very dead.
ROSSI, Mmm. Cause of death?
JAKE, Initial assessment
ROSSI, But what do I find when I probe a little farther?
JAKE, Bruising around the neck. And ocean water in the lungs.
ROSSI," Ooh, how long have you been dead, body?"
JAKE, Four days.
ROSSI, Gross. Bloating. Odors.
JAKE," Oh, uh, 24 hours."
ROSSI, Perfect.
JAKE, Here we go.
AMY," Stop, stop, stop! Weird, weird, weird!"
JAKE," Rosa, what's your call? Weird or sexy?"
ROSA, Weird.
JAKE, I knew it. But also kinda sexy?
ROSA," No. Weird. But more importantly, that's what you were doing while Charles was grinding through paperwork?"
AMY," Told ya. Worst secondary in the unit. What do you guys want from me? You know, I take over a crime scene, I'm a bad secondary. I blow off work to have s*x with a hot coroner, I'm a bad secondary. I can't win."
CHARLES, What are you guys talking about?
JAKE," Um, just weird s*x stuff that has nothing to do with work."
CHARLES, I once had s*x on a futon. And it was in couch mode.
JAKE, Hmm.
AMY," Sarge, all of these are fine. How much longer are you gonna work on this?"
TERRY, It's questions like that that made Van Gogh cut off his ear. You can't put a clock on art. Ten minutes.
AMY, Great. Let's catch this guy so we can give Holt some good news. I wanna cheer him up.
SCULLY," Well, how do you even know he's in a bad mood? I mean, it's impossible to read that guy."
HOLT," This is the most incompetent, worthless report I have ever read in my life! Get your act together or, so help me God, you won't live to see retirement!"
SCULLY," It's like, ""what's that guy thinking?"" You know?"
AMY," I can read him. And if anyone can figure out what's bothering him, it's me. He and I are exactly the same. Except that I'm younger, Cuban, female, single, and straight."
TERRY, Captain Holt's not gay. Captain Holt's gay?
AMY," Seriously, man, just retire."
HOLT," Boyle, where's my paperwork on that DOA? Still waiting on the autopsy report. Supposed to come in first thing this morning, but so far, nothing."
HOLT, This is unacceptable. I'll call the M.E. and find out what happened.
JAKE," Eh, bup-bup-bup-bup-bah. That's not necessary, sir. For the record, I think it's natural causes anyway, but I'm also the secondary in this case. It's my responsibility, so I will head on down there and pick up the report."
HOLT, Good. But don't ever bup-bup-bup-bup me again.
JAKE," Right, I don't know..."
HOLT, Bup-bup-bup-bup... Bup-bup-bup. Just go.
JAKE," Yep, I am going to regret teaching him that one."
BOYLE," Rosa, can I show you something? What's up? Patterson's wife told me that they were going on a cruise together next month, but her credit card bill shows only one ticket booked. Either she's lying or she knew he was gonna die."
ROSA," Huh, nice find, Boyle."
BOYLE, This could be a murder. Where's that autopsy? Jake went down to the M.E. an hour and a half ago. He still hasn't got back to me.
ROSA, Jake went to get the autopsy report?
BOYLE," I know. Isn't he the best? I mean, he's really coming into his own as a secondary. I wanna get him something nice. Does he come across more as a Pinot guy or more of a Shiraz?"
ROSA, You know what? We better go down there. See what's holding him up.
CHARLES, Good call.
ROSSI, Detectives. [Clears throat] Hello.
ROSA, Shirt's buttoned wrong.
DR. ROSSI," Huh. So it is. Well, how can I help you?"
BOYLE," Uh, we came by to get that autopsy report. Hmm. Is Detective Peralta here? I haven't seen him. Thanks for coming by."
ROSA, Hold on. Found him.
JAKE," Ah, thank goodness you're here. I am so lost. Do you know where the vending machines are?"
JAKE," Look, it's not what it seems like. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Here's what happened. I came down here to get the autopsy report and in conclusion, here we are. Now if you'll excuse me..."
ROSA," Cut the crap, Peralta. Look, I'm sorry I slowed down the autopsy results, but everyone knows it's natural causes."
BOYLE, Not anymore. We think it could be a murder.
JAKE," Wait, like a murder murder, or, like, his mouth murdered him by making him eat so much food that his heart exploded?"
ROSA, Murder murder.
ROSSI, We need the autopsy to be sure.
ROSSI, I have not gotten to that yet.
CHARLES," You guys have been down here for two hours. What, did you have s*x 40 times?"
JAKE," 40 times? No, Charles, like... Look, I'm sorry. We didn't know it was a homicide."
CHARLES," Well, it shouldn't matter. I'm your primary and I asked you to do something. So if it's okay, I'd like to be upset with you."
JAKE," It's more than okay. It's okay times two. Now, Dr. Rossi, will you please perform the autopsy for us right now?"
ROSSI," Actually, with a body this size, I'd need my assistant, and I gave him the rest of the afternoon off when Jake showed up."
JAKE," Guilty. Okay, fine. I will act as your assistant because I am a wonderful secondary. How gross could it be?"
ROSSI, Just gonna need you to hold open this chest cavity for me.
JAKE," Oh. Wow. Okay, I can do that. It's no big deal. Just like holding open some slimy elevator doors. For a family of aliens... Oh, my God."
ROSSI," Yep, there are some signs of stress on the heart, but that's not surprising. Oh, will you look at that stomach lining? God, that is just a beaut."
JAKE, Ugh.
ROSSI, All right. I'm gonna need you to go ahead and take your hand...
ROSSI," Yep, get it down there."
ROSSI, Get it down there. Get it on in
ROSSI ," There you go. Oh, that is so big."
HOLT, Caught him?
AMY," Yes, sir. He was easy to pick up. He looked just like the sergeant's sketch."
SCULLY," You could be a professional artist, boss. Like on the boardwalk."
TERRY, You think I should draw caricatures? That's garbage art! I don't draw giant-head people on surfboards!
SCULLY, I'm saying you could. You're that good.
AMY," Captain, the credit really goes to sergeant Jeffords. Without his refined artistic skills..."
HOLT, Finish the paperwork by noon. I want it included in the crime stats.
PERP," I gotta say, I always hate how I look in pictures, but that is so flattering. Also, I'm innocent."
TERRY, Shut up.
AMY," Sarge, I need you to do one more drawing for me. What? It'll cheer the Captain up. He'll be over the moon. He may even lean back in his chair a little and nod slightly."
TERRY," This is a lot of pressure. If I'm gonna do this, it has to be done right. Scully, get me my oils."
SCULLY, Paint or massage? I'll get both.
ROSSI," You know, this is one of the most unhealthy people I've ever seen. It's like cutting into a big, overstuffed ravioli. Sure you want me to keep digging?"
JAKE," Unfortunately, yes. If the primary on this case says it's a murder, we have to treat it like a murder."
ROSSI, Okay. Here we go. Oh. Wanna see something cool?
JAKE, No.
ROSSI, Here it is. That's what I'm talking about. [Gasps] Listen. Goosh.
JAKE, Mm-hmm.
ROSSI," You know what that was? That was the air releasing from the large intestine. [Sighs] In the biz, we call that ""the death bubble."" It's pretty cool. Here, you wanna hold it?"
JAKE, No!
AMY, Knock knock.
HOLT, You can knock with your hands. Saying it is ridiculous.
AMY," Okay. Well, I know you're having a bad day... I think you're having a bad day. So, to cheer you up I had Terry do this painting to replace the photo you hated."
HOLT, I threw away the photo because I think it's ostentatious to hang pictures of yourself. Especially when you haven't earned a place on the wall.
AMY, Oh.
HOLT," But you would have me hang a baroque oil painting of myself like I'm a north Korean dictator. What? No ornate gold frame? Why am I not astride my noble steed, clad in armor? We could add a horse. You just wasted your time, Terry's time, and now my time on this when you should have been filing a report on the purse-snatcher."
AMY," Oh, I did. It's already in the system."
CAPTAIN, Oh. Mm-hmm. Good. Thank you. Dismissed.
ROSSI," Here are the contents of his stomach. Oh, that's where they went. And here's the really cool part. Get in here, look at the scarring on this liver. Cause of death"
JAKE," Boyle was right. All right, I'm gonna go tell him."
ROSSI," Yeah, you could. Or you could stay for a post-mortem."
JAKE," Nope. Sorry. The spell has worn off. No more weird dead guy s*x for me ever again. It's nothing personal, I just think s*x is for the living. Isn't that right, buddy? Oh, my God, he has no eyes! Oh, that is terrifying."
AMY," What now, Santiago?"
AMY, I figured out why you've been so tense. You're worried about the monthly crime statistics.
HOLT, That's not your concern.
AMY, I just checked the stats myself. Our arrest numbers haven't improved since you got here. They're exactly the same as last month.
HOLT," If this is your strategy to cheer me up, it's backfiring."
AMY," Sir, I don't think you realize how good flat numbers are. I went back 12 years. A precinct's numbers almost always get worse under new leadership, but ours didn't. That's a win. It's just your first month. Morale is much higher, people are working harder, you're well on your way to earning a place on that wall."
HOLT," Thank you, Santiago."
AMY," You know, we're birds of a feather, you and I."
HOLT, I hate cliches.
AMY, Cliches are the worst. Okay.
CHARLES," We know you killed your husband. That cruise you planned was for one, plus the autopsy showed clear signs of poison."
JAKE," And for the record, the inside of his body was very gross."
CHARLES," Noted. My only question is, why'd you do it?"
MRS PATTERSON," Um, he drove me to it. He had affair after affair. He was a real don Juan."
JAKE, Permission to make a fat joke?
CHARLES, Granted.
JAKE," Are you sure you didn't mean ""don flan""? Thanks."
CHARLES," Nice. Mrs. Patterson, you are under arrest for the murder of your husband."
ROSA," Sarge, that painting is tight."
TERRY, It's terrible. The brushwork is sloppy. There's poor use of negative space. I'm a fraud.
HOLT, Not at all. I'd like to take this home for my husband. He'll be glad you made me look so happy.
TERRY, I was trying to make him look serious. I still can't read him.
ROSA, No one can.
AMY, I can. He likes it.
DIAZ," Nice job, Boyle. You nailed it."
JAKE," Here. Of course he did. He's a great primary. And I'm sorry I was such a bad number two. I may, for the first time, have been a bit of a jerk, and I'm sorry."
CHARLES, What a wonderful moment.
JAKE," I agree, it is a wonderful moment. What a wonderful moment. Rosa, do you agree?"
ROSA, It's all right. It's all right
CHARLES, Oh. D.A. wants to set bail for Patterson's wife. They need me to send them all the files.
JAKE, I'm the secondary. I'll go back there and do the busy work. You guys stay here and keep celebrating.
ROSA, You sure you're not just sneaking off for more weird dead guy s*x?
JAKE," We will never speak of that again. Never. Okay, bye."
CHARLES," God. Crazy day, huh?"
ROSA, I hate small talk. Let's drink in silence.
CHARLES, Perfect.
