Tracking the current stats:
- Count of speaking lines per character
- Count of speaking lines per episode
- Total number of terms in all episodes
- Average number of terms per line

Planning to Track:
- Most used terms (top 10?) per character*
- Most popular terms (top 10?) per episode*
- Most popular terms (top 10?) in the show*
- Characters most often mentioned in tweets
- Average length of each tweet
- Total amount of tweets
- Percentage of tweets that mention each character above a certain number of speaking lines
- Tweets over time (graphic)


*May require a list of stopwords so that terms like "the"/"and"/"a" aren't counted
